# Fraction_Multiplication_Using_Structures

Organize data using structures.
Use Structures to group related but dissimilar data types.
Write structured programming instructions so that the computer shows
input/output behaviors. Instructions

Fraction Sum

Create a struct to hold a fraction. The struct should have an integer numerator
and an integer denominator member. Declare 2 fraction variables and read them in
from the user. Write a function called multiply that takes both fractions,
multiplies them together, and prints the result out as a fraction
(numerator/denominator). You do not need to reduce the fraction to its lowest
terms.

// Enter the first fractional numbers in the format given below:
// numerator(space)(symbol)(space)denominator (e.g. 2 / 5)


Sample input/output:

Enter first fractional number: 2 / 5
Enter second fractional number: 1 / 6
Resultant fractional number: 2 / 30
